# Species occurrences for red listing

Code for compiling species distribution records for red list assessments (or other purposes)

Red list assessments require a spatial dataset of the species' distributions because many of the criteria rely on spatially explicit measures, e.g., number of locations, Area of Occupancy (AOO), Extent of Occurrence (EOO), whether it has a restricted range, etc. For this study, the sandy beach species distributions are compiled as point data from from [GBIF](GBIF.org), [iNaturalist](www.inaturalist.org), field sampling and published records in the literature that are not on GBIF or iNaturalist.

For repeatability, transparency, and efficiency, the data were compiled in R into a dataset that is in the format required by the [IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards). The code used to compile and output the data is provided.

This code is supplementary material to the following paper:

Harris, L.R., Raimondo, D., Sink, K., Holness, S.D., Skowno, A.L., 2025. Sandy beach ecosystem and species red listing highlight priorities for beach conservation and restoration.

Note: A list of links to the individual species assessments will be added to this repository when the assessments are published on the IUCN website as part of the next update of the Red List of Species (anticipated: October 2025).
